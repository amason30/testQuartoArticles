This repository was created to test the ability of using quarto (.qmd) files as articles for R packages when builing a website with pkgdown. Further it shows how to ensure the website builds correctly when deployed with GitHub actions.

As of version 2.1.1, pkgdown supports the [use of quarto](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/quarto.html) vignettes. Yay! This is awesome, quarto has so many great features and has awesome extensions in VS code and other IDE's. However, vignettes != articles. Articles are often used by package developers to show documentation, tutorials, etc. on a resource website for uses. The advantage of using articles is clear for packages analyzing large datasets that you do not want packaged with the package or extra dependencies that are only needed to show data pipelines/integration of your package with other, existing packages. The main difference between an article and vignette, is an vignette is shipped with the package and an article is only displayed on the package website. You can read more on the differences in [Hadley's R packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/vignettes.html#sec-vignettes-article).

The differences between articles and vignettes, and where they are stored (vignettes/articles vs. vignettes), have caused [issues with pkgdown finding the rendered article pages](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2733). [Ethan Bass](https://github.com/ethanbass) shows the issue is linked to a discrepancy between where quarto is rendering the articles vs. where pkgdown is searching for them when `build_quarto_articles()` is called by pkgdown. I would like to note that Ethan created the [modified code](https://github.com/ethanbass/pkgdown) to make this workflow work, this repository is just my personal notes in implementing his fix! Please see the GitHub issue linked above for more infomation in this issue and Ethan's [patched pkgdown](https://github.com/ethanbass/pkgdown) for the code behind the fix!
