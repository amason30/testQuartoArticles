This repository was created to test the ability of using quarto (.qmd) files as articles for R packages when builing a website with pkgdown. Further it shows how to ensure the website builds correctly when deployed with GitHub actions.

As of version 2.1.1, pkgdown supports the [use of quarto](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/quarto.html) vignettes. Yay! This is awesome, quarto has so many great features and has awesome extensions in VS code and other IDE's. However, vignettes != articles. Articles are often used by package developers to show documentation, tutorials, etc. on a resource website for uses. The advantage of using articles is clear for packages analyzing large datasets that you do not want packaged with the package or extra dependencies that are only needed to show data pipelines/integration of your package with other, existing packages. The main difference between an article and vignette, is an vignette is shipped with the package and an article is only displayed on the package website. You can read more on the differences in [Hadley's R packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/vignettes.html#sec-vignettes-article).
